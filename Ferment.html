    <h2>Fermentation</h2>
    <p>
      The most important step in the beer making process, fermentation is where
      the magic happens. This is the critical time when the yeast converts the
      sugars into ethyl alcohol and CO2. While fermentation does not require
      uninterrupted attention like the brew, you need to keep a close eye
      throughout the entire period of time that it takes to complete the
      process.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is recommended that you separate fermentation into two steps: primary
      fermentation and secondary fermentation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Primary Fermentation</h3>

    />

    <p>
      The main purpose of primary fermentation is to allow the yeast to convert
      the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Additionally, the process will
      allow unwanted particles to sink to the bottom of the vessel, separating
      them from the beer. The collection of these particles is known as “trub”
      and is comprised of dead yeast cells, extraneous proteins and hops. This
      process will take roughly one week, dependent upon the style of beer that
      you are making. With the yeast in the mix, respiration must first occur
      then active primary fermentation should begin in about 12 hours. It is
      important to maintain a temperature around 68 to 72°F for healthy
      fermentation to take place. When active fermentation has commenced you
      will notice a release of CO2 gas from the vessel. When using an airlock,
      you will notice bubbling within the airlock chamber. This means that the
      yeast is successfully converting the sugars. As bubbling starts to occur
      less frequently, this can be taken as a sign that primary fermentation is
      nearing completion. At this time you’ll want to transfer the beer to a
      secondary fermentation vessel.
    </p>

    <h3>Is secondary fermentation necessary?</h3>

    <p>
      No. Secondary fermentation is not necessary, but provides a lot of
      benefits when you make beer at home. It is the stage in which the beer can
      further clarify and become more polished. However, if executed
      incorrectly, it can also serve as an opportunity to introduce infection
      and other factors that may have a negative effect on your brew. If
      executed correctly, secondary fermentation will result in a better looking
      and better tasting product. If you choose to skip secondary fermentation,
      simply allow the beer to ferment for 2-3 weeks in the primary fermenter.
    </p>

    <h3>transferring (aka:racking)</h3>

    <p>
        For those that choose to go for it, you will need to transfer (or “rack”, as it’s known in brewing) the beer from the primary fermenter to the secondary fermenter as carefully as possible without disturbing the trub or transferring the byproducts of fermentation that collect at the top of the beer, known as “Kraeusen” (kroy-zen). You will also want to ensure that anything that comes in contact with the beer is properly cleaned and sanitized.

        The primary fermenter should be located at a higher elevation than the secondary fermenter to allow gravity to do its thing when siphoning. If it is not, then you should move the primary fermenter 24 hours prior to racking to allow any sediment that could have been re-suspended within the beer to resettle. Rack the beer from the primary fermenter to the secondary fermenter while avoiding splashing the beer. You want to eliminate any possibility of reintroducing oxygen to the beer as oxidized beer can mean a stale-tasting beer with other undesired flavors.
        
        Once you have successfully transferred to the secondary fermenter, securely insert an airlock or blow-off valve and place the fermenter in a cool, dark place.

<h3>Secondary Fermentation</h3>
<p>
    While the more active stage of fermentation has already taken place during primary fermentation, some remaining fermentables and active yeast cells remain. Moving your beer to a secondary fermenter and allowing it to condition further will let the remaining yeast convert the more complex sugars and will ultimately improve the quality of your beer by increasing clarity, smoothing out the flavor profile and reducing the risk of infection and introduction of off-tasting flavors. 
</p>
<p>
    The secondary fermentation stage is also typically when brewers choose to dry hop the beer. Dry hopping is the process of directly infusing additional bitterness, flavor and aroma from hops into your beer. Of course, dry hopping is style-dependent (more for IPAs and other hoppy beers), but secondary fermentation is an ideal time to dry hop because the vigorous fermentation and rapid release of CO2 has already taken place, allowing the oil and aroma from the hops to set in peacefully.

    You should allot at least one week’s time for the secondary fermentation phase to complete, but can certainly make it longer if you wish.

<h3>Final Gravity Reading & Alcohol Content</h3>

<p>
    Once your beer has had ample time within the secondary fermenter, it’s time to take the final gravity reading, or “FG”.
</p>
<p>
    The final gravity will allow you to calculate exactly how much work your yeast has done during fermentation, and subsequently, your beer’s alcohol content.  
</p>
<p>
    You will take your FG reading just as you took the OG reading, making sure that you continue to stick with the theme of proper sanitization.

    Once you have attained the reading, you can calculate the alcohol content by subtracting the FG from the OG, then multiplying that number by 131 – so, OG – FG x 131.  
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Example: </strong>1.060 (OG) – 1.020 (FG) x 131 = 5.24% ABV</p>

<p>
    Now that you know exactly how much alcohol is in your beer, you must be getting thirsty. Unfortunately, the beer is not yet carbonated and requires further conditioning, so you must decide how you want to store, carbonate and serve your beer.
