    <h2>3. Steps In the Brewing Process</h2>
    ​
    <p>
      Now that you know the ways by which you can brew, let’s run through the
      steps.
    </p>
    ​
    <h3>The Mash</h3>

    <p>
      The first step of brewing beer is the mash, or mashing. ​ The mash is the
      process of activating enzymes in the grain to change starches into sugar,
      ultimately providing the necessary “food” for the yeast. It will also
      create the base for the color, body and overall flavor of your beer.
      Mashing is somewhat similar to steeping tea. You will immerse your grain
      bill in hot water, allowing the heat to gently break down starches and
      activate the important enzymes within the grain that, ultimately, leads to
      those starches being converted to fermentable sugars. A few important
      things to be mindful of for the mash are water quality, temperature and
      stirring.

    <h2>Lautering</h2>

    <p>
      The next step is lautering, which is the process of separating the wort
      from the grain. ​ The purpose is to remove sugars that may be trapped
      within the grain following the mash. The reason for doing this is to get
      the biggest bang for your buck. As previously mentioned, sugar is what
      feeds the yeast, ultimately converting into alcohol and making beer just
      that instead of non-alcoholic sugar water – the more food for the yeast,
      the greater the potential for successful fermentation. Lautering can be
      completed by various methods dependent on the type of brewing, but
      regardless of which method is used it will almost always involve a step
      called “sparging”. Sparging involves heating water in a separate container
      to a higher temperature than that of the mash, then pouring the heated
      water over the grain to “rinse” it of any remaining sugars. In more
      advanced brewing, this can involve extra equipment but follows the same
      general principle.
    </p>
    ​
    <h2>The Boil</h2>

    <p>
      The boil can sometimes be confused with the mash, but they are actually
      two very different processes. ​ The mash, which converts starches into
      sugars, does not actually do so at a boiling temperature. However, the
      boil is appropriately named. The temperature is much higher than that of
      the mash (around 212°F depending upon altitude) and occurs over a longer
      period of time. The purpose of the boil is to destroy remaining unwanted
      enzymes, remove harmful oxygen and to stabilize the wort by lowering pH,
      ultimately creating the perfect environment for the addition of hops. Hops
      are a key ingredient in beer making and can be used in many different ways
      to achieve an even wider range of desired effects. Though, no matter what
      you’re looking for in the end, hops provide balance to the beer by adding
      bitterness to counteract the sweetness of the grain. During the boil, hops
      can also be added at later increments to add flavor and aroma to the beer.
      Hops also serve as a natural preservative that can protect the beer from
      bacteria and other potential infections. In all, the boil should create a
      healthy environment in which fermentation can successfully take place.
