    <h2>1. Cleaning & Sanitizing</h2>
    <img id="cleansanitation" src="./images/cleaning-sanitation.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Once you have all of the necessary equipment, the first step isn’t actually brewing at all.
​
        First, you’ll need to thoroughly clean and sanitize ALL of your equipment. This step is crucial. Do not take any shortcuts here.
        
        Absolutely anything that will come in contact with your beer during the brewing process should be properly cleaned using an unscented mild detergent, then sanitized using a solution that is approved for sanitation, such as Five Star Star-San. I would recommend no-rinse varieties, as they simplify the process while remaining effective.
        
        Once you’ve properly cleaned and sanitized your equipment, it’s time to get brewing! </p>
