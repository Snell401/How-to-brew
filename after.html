      <H3>After the Brew</H3>
      <p>With the brewing phase now complete, it’s time to prepare the wort for fermentation. This process involves quickly reducing the temperature of the wort, adding water, taking a gravity reading, then adding the yeast (also known as “pitching”).</p>

    <h3>Cool Down</h3>

    <p>Once the boil is over, it’s time to cool the wort down as quickly as possible to prevent infection. The goal is to get the wort down to around room temperature in less than 20 minutes.

        Depending on how large your batch is as well as the ambient temperature, this could prove to be a straightforward task or a very challenging one. There are many ways to cool down the wort.</p>
<h4>Ice bath</h4>
<p>
    When first learning how to brew beer, most homebrewers start with the most simplest method of cooling down wort — an ice bath.

Depending on the size of your batch, you can fill your sink, bathtub or any other large container with cold water, and then load it up with ice. There’s no limit to how cold your ice bath can be – the colder it is, the faster you will be able to bring down the temperature of the wort.

Once you’ve created the ice bath, slowly submerge the brew pot and then stir the wort constantly to more effectively distribute and dissipate the heat. When placing the pot in the bath, be extra careful to avoid splashing as you do not want any of the water to accidentally get into the pot. With the pot and wort at a very high temperature, the ice will most likely melt at a rapid rate, so add ice as needed until you reach room temperature.
</p>

<h4>Wort Chillers</h4>

    There are also more advanced and effective techniques for cooling the wort, such as wort chillers, which come in immersion, counterflow and plate varieties. These are well worth the additional investment as they are more effective in reducing temperature and can be used time and time again without ever having to worry about ice.
    
    While successfully cooling your wort down can be difficult at first, the good news is, as with everything in brewing, the more practice you get the easier it becomes.

<h3>Transfer to the Primary Fermenter & Original Gravity Reading</h3>

<p>Now that you’ve cooled the wort, transfer it to a storage vessel for primary fermentation. This vessel should be large enough to hold the wort and, if necessary, the sterile topping-up water that you add.

    Once you have the proper volume of liquid, it’s time to take the first gravity reading. The reading will provide you with the wort’s specific gravity, which is its density in relation to the density of water. In the end, checking the gravity of your wort will help you ensure that you had a successful fermentation and will also allow you to calculate your beer’s alcohol content (also known as alcohol by volume, or “ABV”).
    
    How to Brew Beer
    You can take your first gravity reading (also known as original gravity, or “OG”) by using a hydrometer. A hydrometer is a tool that is used to measure specific gravity. In order to take a reading, you must first retrieve a sample of your wort and place it in a container.
    
    A hydrometer test jar or cylindrical container that is similar in size will work best, and most hydrometers even come packaged in a tube that will work as well. Once you have placed the wort sample into the container, place the hydrometer in the container and make sure that it is fully suspended within the liquid. The line that the liquid matches up with is the OG. Record this number and make sure that you can reference it after fermentation is complete.</p>

    <h3>Activating & Pitching the yeast</h3>

    <p>
        Once you have taken your gravity reading, it is time to add the yeast. In the brewing world, this step is known as “pitching”. You want to first ensure that your yeast is ready for pitching, so before you even begin the brew, it is especially important to be mindful of yeast health.

        Make sure that your yeast is ready come pitch time by letting it sit out at room temperature for about 3 hours beforehand. Doing so will make for better fermentation and, subsequently, better beer.  
    </p>

    <h3>Types of Brewing Yeast</h3>

    <p>
        Brewing yeast (not the same as baking yeast) can come in dry or liquid form with each having its own advantages over the other. Use of each type is at the discretion of the brewer, but regardless of which type you choose to use, ensure that your yeast is ready for pitching.
        
        <ul>
            <li>Dry Yeast — Commonly found in ingredient kits, dry yeast will not require activation but should be at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Liquid Yeast — Liquid yeast, on the other hand, will require activation by vigorously shaking the container and perhaps even creating a yeast starter prior to pitching. A yeast starter will simply prime the yeast for fermentation by allowing it to multiply prior to pitching.</li>
        </ul>

        Once your yeast is ready, pitch it into the vessel that you will use for fermentation and aerate the mixture by stirring vigorously with a sanitized spoon or securing the lid and shaking the vessel. It is important to aerate the mixture because doing so reintroduces oxygen back into the wort that was previously removed during the boil. Oxygen is necessary for the growth of the yeast, which will ultimately complete the fermentation process.

Now that the yeast has joined the party and the mixture is properly aerated, secure an airtight lid on the vessel and securely insert a sanitized airlock or similar blow-off valve that will allow CO2 gases to escape while preventing outside air from entering.
