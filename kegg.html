    <p>
      When preparing your beer for consumption, you must store it in an airtight
      vessel, allowing it to carbonate and condition. There are two main
      methods: bottling and kegging. In homebrewing, bottling has long been
      accepted as the simplest method, but kegging has quickly grown in
      popularity, making a case as the better method of the two. Truth be told,
      there is no right or wrong way and each method has its own advantages.

    <h3>Bottling Beer</h3>

    <p> Bottling is an inexpensive option, making it the go-to choice for many
    homebrewers. Also, many equipment and ingredient kits come with all the
    <a class="link-word" href="https://learn.kegerator.com/bottling-beer/">items you will need </a> items you will need for the bottling process. </p>
    <p>Most brewing equipment kits come with a bottling bucket, siphon, tubing, bottle filler,capper, a beer bottle brush and sanitizer – so, all you need to add are
    bottles and caps. And most ingredient kits come with priming sugar, and some
    even come with caps, too. With many kits created with bottling in mind, it
    becomes an easy choice for homebrewers.</p> 

    <br>
    <h3>How to bottle Beer</h3>
    <p>If you decide to bottle your beer, you will need to follow these steps</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First, properly sanitize everything that will come in contact with the beer.</li>
        <li> Then add the priming sugar to the empty bottling bucket. Rack the beer to the bottling bucket from the secondary fermenter, which will also mix the two.</li>
        <li>Then attach the tubing that you use for racking to the spigot on the bottling bucket.</li>
        <li> Attach the bottle filler to the other end of the tubing and begin bottling your beer by inserting the bottle filler into a sanitized bottle and pushing down.</li>
        <li>The bottle will quickly begin to fill and once the beer reaches 3/4 of an inch to the top of the bottle lift up the bottle filler to stop the flow.</li>
        <li>  Then, place a cap on the mouth of the bottle and carefully cap the bottle by using the capper to bend the edge of the cap down around the mouth.</li>
        <li>   Repeat all of the steps until your batch is completely bottled.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Once the batch is bottled, store all of the bottles in a cool, dark place for at least two weeks. This allows the beer to go through its final conditioning phase and lets the yeast ferment the priming sugar to produce CO2 to carbonate the beer. After the beer has had time to condition and carbonate, chill it and enjoy!

    <h3>Kegging Beer</h3>

    <p>
        More and more homebrewers are choosing to keg their beer, as it is an overall easier and quicker process than bottling. Though, it does require a greater initial investment as you’ll need all of the proper storage, carbonating and serving equipment.

        At the minimum, you will need a keg, refrigeration box of some kind (typically a kegerator), a CO2 cylinder and regulator. You will also need the necessary lines, as well as a coupler or adapter to feed CO2 to the keg and dispense beer from it.
        
        A kegerator is typically the preferred choice for homebrewers, as it comes with everything you need. However, many homebrewers prefer to convert an old fridge or freezer into their own DIY kegerator, as well as use it as a fermenting chamber. This is something you may want to consider.

    <h3>How to kegg beer</h3>

    <p>
        If you decide to keg your beer, you will need to follow these steps. 
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Just like bottling, you will want to properly sanitize any equipment that will come in contact with the beer.</li>
        <li>Once you have completed this, you can rack the beer from the secondary fermenter to the keg.</li>
        <li>Then you can seal the keg and connect it to the CO2 cylinder for carbonation.</li>
        <li>When kegging beer you do not need priming sugar to carbonate as you use CO2 to carbonate the beer.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        Actual carbonation levels are dependent upon the temperature of the beer you are carbonating as well as the desired volume of CO2 within the beer. Once you have figured out the desired carbonation level, set the regulator to the appropriate PSI level and allow the keg to carbonate for at least four days. Once the keg is fully carbonated, lower the PSI for serving and enjoy!
